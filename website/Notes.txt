TODO:
	Add error handling to the website so that we can inform the user when the server returns a 500 Error Status Code

	Allow the course visual to scroll down the page with you (remove from flow?)

	Consolidate class selection into a single modal (eliminating need for subjects table) by allowing type-ahead into a blank field.
	The old style is still useful though, is it possible to have both?
