TODO:
	Allow the course visual to scroll down the page with you (remove from flow?)

	Consolidate class selection into a single modal (eliminating need for subjects table) by allowing type-ahead into a blank field.
	The old style is still useful though, is it possible to have both?

	Start using Require.js to speed js loading
	Move toward MVC style by creating a central data structure
	that stores the class data and updates tables and canvas
	seperately from their handlers.
