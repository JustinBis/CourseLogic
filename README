This repo contains the source code for my website-in-progress, CourseLogic.

The website allows students with complex schedules to select classes more easily and visualize their choices.
The frontend is static webpages that are driven by javascript.
jQuery is extensively used to handle events and Ajax requests to a backend server that is run by node.js
For simplicity, this same server will also serve the static pages.
